# MyReads
***
MyReads is a personal library and reading list app that allows you to create book collections and connect with friends to facilitate book lending. You can keep track of books you own or want to read by adding them to customizable collections. After friending other users, you can request to borrow titles from your friend network. MyReads will always keep track of what titles you've borrowed and lent out so you'll never forget who borrowed that copy of your favorite book again!

MyReads was developed as a final project for Hackbright Academy.

# Version 2.0

##### Interactivity
I'd love to create more interactivity between friends such as a viewable recently read feature, implementing a rating function or pulling in Goodreads ratings for books, and the ability to contact friends directly from the app. I'd also like to add the ability of updating current collections to edit the names or back a collection lendable or private after creation.
